algorithms, and documentation (the “Software”) solely for:

1. Non-commercial academic research

PROHIBITED USES
----------------------------------------------------------------

The Software, or any derivative work, extension, model, or system
based on the Software, SHALL NOT be used, directly or indirectly, for:

1. Any forced, coerced, mandatory, or non-consensual
   modification of the human body, brain, nervous system,
   cognition, identity, or behavior.

2. Any involuntary, forced, mandatory, or coerced
   psychiatric, psychological, neurological, or behavioral
   intervention, assessment, classification, or treatment,
   including uses justified under “mental health,”
   “public safety,” or “risk mitigation” frameworks.

3. Any integration of artificial intelligence, computation,
   or technological systems into the human body or brain
   without the individual’s explicit, informed, and voluntary
   consent.

4. Any system intended to control, manipulate, restrict,
   surveil, coerce, profile, or dominate individuals or
   populations.

5. Any technology that conditions access to food, housing,
   healthcare, employment, financial systems, civil services,
   or basic human rights on adoption of technological
   augmentation, psychiatric compliance, or AI-mediated
   control.

6. Any use for population control, social credit systems,
   behavioral enforcement, predictive policing,
   mass surveillance, or psychological coercion.

7. Military, intelligence, law-enforcement, carceral,
   detention, or surveillance applications.

8. Any use that undermines human dignity, autonomy,

   as programmable, optimizable, or enforceable objects.
