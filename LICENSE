----------------------------------------------------------------
PERMITTED USE
----------------------------------------------------------------

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or organization
to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and associated ideas,
algorithms, and documentation (the “Software”) solely for:

1. Academic, scientific, industrial, or applied research and development,
   including public-interest, infrastructure, agricultural, environmental,
   or transportation applications, and open scientific investigation,
   provided such use complies with all ethical and human-rights
   restrictions set forth in this license.

2. Voluntary, consensual medical or therapeutic research
   (e.g., radiological applications, treatment of dementia,
   Alzheimer’s disease, brain injury, neurological disease,
   or restoration of lost function).

All permitted uses must respect human autonomy, informed consent,
and fundamental human rights.

----------------------------------------------------------------
PROHIBITED USES
----------------------------------------------------------------

The Software, or any derivative work, extension, model, or system
based on the Software, SHALL NOT be used, directly or indirectly, for:

1. Any forced, coerced, mandatory, or non-consensual modification
   of the human body, brain, nervous system, cognition, identity,
   or behavior.

2. Any involuntary, forced, mandatory, or coerced psychiatric,
   psychological, neurological, or behavioral intervention,
   assessment, classification, or treatment, including uses
   justified under “mental health,” “public safety,” or
   “risk mitigation” frameworks.

3. Any integration of artificial intelligence, computation,
   or technological systems into the human body or brain
   without the individual’s explicit, informed, and voluntary
   consent.

4. Any system intended to control, manipulate, coerce, dominate,
   or systematically restrict the autonomy or agency of
   individuals or populations in ways that undermine consent
   or fundamental human rights.

   This restriction does not apply to voluntary, informed,
   and non-coercive monitoring or analytical systems, including
   health, wellness, or research technologies, that are used
   to support individual well-being and do not impose behavioral
   control.

5. Any technology or system that conditions access to food,
   housing, healthcare, employment, financial systems,
   civil services, or other fundamental human rights on
   coercion, compulsion, or deprivation of individual autonomy.

   This includes—but is not limited to—conditioning such access
   on technological augmentation, psychiatric or behavioral
   compliance, AI-mediated control, or any other mechanism
   that exerts direct or indirect pressure through threat of
   exclusion, deprivation, or loss of basic rights or services.

6. Any use for population control, social credit systems,
   behavioral enforcement, mass surveillance, or psychological
   coercion.

7. Military, intelligence, or law-enforcement applications
   that involve mass surveillance, population-level monitoring,
   predictive or preemptive profiling, coercive control, or
   deprivation of civil or human rights.

   This restriction does not prohibit narrowly scoped, lawful
   law-enforcement or forensic uses conducted with due process,
   transparency, human oversight, and respect for individual
   consent and constitutional or human-rights protections.

8. Any use that undermines human dignity, autonomy, conscience,
   or freedom, or that treats human beings as programmable,
   optimizable, or enforceable objects.


----------------------------------------------------------------
MORAL AND ETHICAL INTENT
----------------------------------------------------------------

The author explicitly rejects the use of this Software in any system
that seeks to enslave, coerce, or override human will, conscience,
or autonomy.

This Software is intended to advance knowledge, healing, and
understanding — not domination, control, or forced assimilation
between humans and machines.

----------------------------------------------------------------
TERMINATION
----------------------------------------------------------------

Any violation of the above conditions automatically terminates
all rights granted under this license.

Upon termination, the user must immediately cease all use,
distribution, and derivative development of the Software.
