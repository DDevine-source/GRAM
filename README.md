# GRAM
GRAM (Gravitationally Regularized Associative Memory)  is a new class of NN algorithm.  A gravitational manifold learner that performs stable recall from multi-objective spaces by minimizing local curvature rather than a global scalar objective.  It’s semi-supervised, and performs physics-structured retrieval and inference on a learned manifold.
